# Javascript

# What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript (JS)** is a **programming language** used to make websites **interactive and dynamic**.

### What JS can do:

- Show pop-ups (alert)
- Take user input (prompt)
- React to clicks, typing, scrolling
- Change HTML & CSS dynamically
- Build games, forms, chatbots, apps

### Role in Web Development:

- **HTML** → Structure
- **CSS** → Styling
- **JavaScript** → Logic / Behaviour

# How JavaScript Runs?

JavaScript runs in:

**1  Browser (using JavaScript Engine)**

Every browser has a **JavaScript Engine to convert javaScript code into machine understandable code** .

Examples:

- Google Chrome → **V8 Engine**
- Mozilla Firefox → SpiderMonkey
- cpp → compiler

### **What does JS Engine do?**

  Converts **JavaScript code → Machine code**

  JavaScript is **single-threaded so e**xecutes it step by step i.e., executes one line at a time.

   ****

**2  Server (using Node.js – later)**

For beginners → **Browser Console**

## JavaScript Output Methods

JavaScript can show output in **multiple ways**.

1. console.log()

```jsx
let age = 20;
console.log(age);

```

2.alert()

`alert()` displays a **popup message** on screen. User input is not available.

```jsx
alert("Welcome to JavaScript");
```

1. Prompt()

It is a way to take input when a popup pops and returns a value. 

```jsx
let name = prompt("Enter your name");
console.log(name);

```

Prompt always returns strings. Use Number() or parseInt() to convert to int.

```jsx
let age = Number(prompt("Enter age"));
let age = parseInt(prompt("Enter age"));
```

```jsx
let name = prompt("Enter your name");
alert(`Hello ${name}`);

let age=Number(prompt("Enter your age")) ;//by default string
if (isNaN(age)) {
  alert("Please enter a valid number");
} else {
  alert("Your age is " + age);
}
```

## What is a Variable?

A **variable** is a container that stores data.

## Types of Variable Declaration

---

| Features | Var(old-causes bug) | Let(ES6-2015) Modern and mutable | Const(fixed) Modern and immutable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | Function or Global | Block Scope {} | Block Scoped {} |
| Redefinition/Reassignment(Changing value) | Allowed | Allowed | Not allowed |
| Redeclaration | Allowed | Not allowed(Syntax error) | Not allowed |
| Hoisting | Yes(as undefined) | Yes(as TDZ- Temporal Dead Zone) | Temporal Dead Zone |

```jsx
var x = 10;
var x = 20; // Redeclaration: Allowed
x = 30;     // Reassignment: Allowed
console.log(x); // 30
```

```jsx
let y = 10;
// let y = 20; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'y' has already been declared
y = 30;        // Reassignment: Allowed
console.log(y); // 30
```

# Hoisting and Temporal Dead Zone

## What is Hoisting?

**Hoisting** is JavaScript’s default behavior of **moving declarations to the top of their scope during the memory creation phase** *before code execution*.

- **Only declarations are hoisted**
- **Not initializations**

## Hoisting happens in Memory Creation Phase

### JavaScript Execution Phases

When JS runs code, it happens in **2 phases**:

### Phase 1: Memory Creation Phase

- Variables are allocated memory
- Functions are stored completely

### Phase 2: Execution Phase

- Code runs line by line
- Values are assigned

  Hoisting happens in **Phase 1**

## Hoisting with `var`

Before hoisting on declaration:

```jsx
console.log(a);
var a = 10;
```

After hoisting on declaration:

```jsx
// Memory phase
var a = undefined;

// Execution phase
console.log(a); // undefined
a = 10;
```

var(only the declaration) is hoisted and initialized with undefined.

Hence output is **undefined**

## Hoisting with `let`

Before hoisting on declaration:

```jsx
console.log(a);
let a = 10;

```

```jsx
console.log(addtwo(5));
let addtwo=function(num){
    return num+2;
}
```

### This introduces to Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

**Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** is the **time between variable creation and its initialization where the variable cannot be accessed**.

This applies to:

- `let`
- `const`

### Why TDZ Exists?

TDZ exists to:

- Prevent usage before declaration
- Reduce bugs
- Enforce clean coding

After hoisting on declaration:

```jsx
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
```

Without TDZ → silent bugs

With TDZ → clear error

## Hoisting with `const`

Before Hoisting:

```jsx
console.log(pi);
const pi =3.14;
```

### 

Output after hoisting:

```
ReferenceError
```

### Rules for `const`:

    Must be initialized immediately

```jsx
const a;// ❌ SyntaxError
```

# VARIABLE NAMING RULES

### Naming Convention allowed-

- Letters (a–z, A–Z)
- Numbers at center only
- `_` underscore
- `$` dollar sign

### Naming Convention not allowed-

- Cannot start with number
- No spaces
- No special characters (`@ #`)

# Datatypes and categories

### 1 Primitive (Stored by VALUE)

- String(Immutable)
- Number
- Boolean
- Undefined
- Null
- Symbol
- BigInt

### 2 Non-Primitive (Stored by REFERENCE)

- Object
- Array
- Function

# OPERATORS IN JAVASCRIPT

| Arithmetic Operator | +,-,*,/,%,** |
| --- | --- |
| Assignment Operator | =,+=,-=,*=,/= |
| Comparison Operator | >,<,≥,≤ |
| Logical Operator | &&,!,|| |
| Unary Operator | ++,— |
| typeof Operator | typeof(true) |

# EQUALITY & COMPARISON

## 1 Loose Equality (`==`)

Compares **value only**, ignores the data type.

```jsx
5 == "5"; // true
```

## 2 Strict Equality (`===`)

Compares **value and data type**.

```jsx
5 === "5"; // false
```

## 3 Not Equal Operators(!=, !==)

```jsx

5 != "5";  // false
5 !== "5"; // true
```

### Examples-

null == undefined;  // true
null === undefined; // false

0 == false;  // true
0 === false; // false
